# Heart Failure Prediction

**Description:**

The dataset comprises 918 instances and 12 features related to cardiovascular health, aimed at predicting heart disease. Each instance includes information such as the patient's age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, presence of exercise-induced angina, ST depression measured during exercise, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. The target variable, "HeartDisease," indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease. This dataset facilitates exploratory data analysis and the development of predictive models to assist in early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases, which are a leading cause of global mortality.
